<h1>SimME - <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/simme/">@berlios</a></h1>

	<p>What does this stand for? <em><strong>Sim</strong>ulator
	<strong>M</strong>icro<strong>E</strong>dition</em>. In fact this project
	develops a two player game for Java 2 MicroEdition. The game is based on a
	strategy game which can be found at <a
	href="http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/ramsey/">www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/ramsey</a>
	(the simulator). The game will be played via mobile phone against any other
	person around the globe.</p>

	<p>A community page will be set up, providing rankings, stats and a
	possibility to match up. More on this soon.</p>


	<h2>General Information</h2>

	<p>This is the main web page with some current information on the project. The
	most current version is 0.0.5. You can download the release files from the

	<h2>Current Development</h2>

	<p>We are currently working hard on our next release. For the curious: have a
	look at the project's <a href="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/simme">CVS
	web interface</a>. Although some comments are in German, we tried to keep all
	javadoc in English.</p>

	<p>The project is split into two parts. One part builds the client side which
	uses the MIDP-1.0 and CLDC-1.0 specification. The other part develops the
	server side which uses JSPs/Servlets (where we don't have that much experience). The
	two parts communicate via XML over HTTP.</p>

	<p>Currently the development process is held very close but the project will
	soon be opened after we have created something someone else could use. There
	is a short introduction on the <a href="devel-environment.html">development
	environment</a>. Although it is not current, there are some links that can get
	you started.</p>

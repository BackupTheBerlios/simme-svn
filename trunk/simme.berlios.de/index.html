<h1>SimME - <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/simme/">@berlios</a></h1>

  <p>What does this stand for? <em><strong>Sim</strong>ulator
  <strong>M</strong>icro<strong>E</strong>dition</em>. In fact this project
	develops a two player game for Java 2 MicroEdition. The game is based
  on a strategy game which can be found at <a
  href="http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/ramsey/">www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/ramsey</a>
  (the simulator). The game will be played via mobile phone against any other
  person around the globe.</p>

  <p>We are also trying to set up a web page with rankings, stats and a
  possibility to match up. More on this soon.</p>


  <h2>General Information</h2>

  <p>This is the main web page with some current information on the project. The
  most current version is 0.01 and is currently not accessible via the <a
  href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/simme/">project's main page</a>.
  You can download this development version at:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><a href="http://www.einspiel.at/">www.einspiel.at</a></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><font size="-1"><em>Note: the above URL is a WAP page and may be displayed
  incorrectly in some browsers.</em></font></p>

	<p>The files are intended for MIDP-1.0 and CLDC-1.0 specifications. More about
	that at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2me/">java.sun.com/j2me</a> or <a
	href="http://wireless.java.sun.com/">wireless.java.sun.com</a>. The packages
	have been created with the wireless toolkit provided by Sun.</p>


	<h2>Current Development</h2>

	<p>We are currently working hard on our next release. For the curious: have a
  look at the project's <a href="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/simme">CVS
  web interface</a>. Although some comments are in German, we tried to keep all
  javadoc in English.</p>

	<p>The project is split into two parts. One part builds the client side which
  is uses the MIDP-1.0 and CLDC-1.0 specification. The other part develops the
  server side which uses JSPs (we don't have any experience in using JSPs). The
  two parts communicate via XML over HTTP.</p>

	<p>Currently the development process is held very close but the project will soon
  be opened after we have created something someone else could build up upon.</p>
